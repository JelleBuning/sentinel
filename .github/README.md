### Built With

* [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)
* [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
Setting up this solution on your local machine is straightforward and will enable you to fully utilize its capabilities. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get everything running smoothly.

Before beginning, ensure that your development environment is properly configured. Having the required software and dependencies installed will prevent common issues and streamline the process.

### Prerequisites

### Installation
This installation method utilizes Docker Compose for a streamlined setup. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

1.  **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**
    Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in a directory of your choice. Copy and paste the following content into it:

    ```yaml
    version: '3.4'
    name: sentinel
    services:
      sentinel.api:
        container_name: "sentinel.api"
        image: ghcr.io/jellebuning/sentinel.api
        ports:
          - "7000:8080"
        environment:
          ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: "Production" # "Development" | "Production" | "Staging"
          ConnectionStrings__Database: "CONNECTIONSTRING_HERE"

    ```

2.  **Run Docker Compose:**
    In the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This command will download the necessary images, create the containers, and start them in detached mode.


4.  **Access the API:**
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:7000`.

**Important Notes:**

* Replace `"CONNECTIONSTRING_HERE"` with a your database connectionstring.
